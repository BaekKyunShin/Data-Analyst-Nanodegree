# Project Descriptions
### Project 1 - Explore Weather
 Compare the Korean temperature to global average temperature with moving average.

### Project 2 - Predicting Medical Appointment No Shows
 This is Kaggle problem. Dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. There are 14 features in this dataset. The purpose of this analysis is that what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.

### Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results

 A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Project 4 - Treatment Test

 This is a simple wrangling project. It is consisted of gathering, assessing, cleaning.

### Project 5 - Twitter WeRateDog API data Wrangling

 This project is for wrangling data. There are three data sets. Two of them are given by Udacity (which are 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv, image-predictions.tsv), one of them can be taken through 'twitter-API' which is about retweet counts and favorite counts. Those data sets are not cleaned yet. In other words, Those are dirty and messy. The purpose of this project is cleaning the dirty and messy data.

### Project 6 - Bike Rental Data Exploration (Visualization)

 This data set is from <https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data>. This project demonstrates the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. You will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations into polished, explanatory visualizations.
